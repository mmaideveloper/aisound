2. models - multiple

    insert detection
    bee type and  illness detection
    bee predator detection?


3. store images + labels
    what labels( localtion, time, temperature, weather ...? )
    ask bee keeper.

4.  process images for train model 
    web-> login, show images + labels ( from storage)
    approve images -> add to DB , add to scheduler for model training

5.  prepare scheduler = how to train model, how to get train model results
     accuracy, f1, prediction,.....
    Define test sample for 
    approve new model -> web 

-------------------

Model Selection

Use a pre-trained model or train your own using datasets like:

Honey Bee Annotated Image Dataset – includes varroa mite detection

Insect Detect Classification – general insect classification

You can use:

YOLOv5 or YOLOv8 for object detection

CNN (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) for classification and illness detection


1. database to temp storage for user input images/audtio + description
